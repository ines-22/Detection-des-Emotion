# Raspberry Pi Emotion Detection
Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Emotion Detection project! This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi along with a camera module to detect and analyze emotions on human faces in real-time to send the emotions statics to a mobile application throw Firebase. Below you'll find information on how to set up and use this project.

# Usage
* Camera Setup: Ensure that the camera is properly positioned to capture human faces.
* Real-time Emotion Detection: The application will display live video from the camera feed along with detected emotions overlaid on detected faces.

# Technologies Used
* Raspberry Pi: Used as the hardware platform for running the emotion detection application.
* Python: Programming language used for the application.
* OpenCV: Library used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
* TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for training and deploying the emotion detection model.
* Keras: High-level neural networks API, used for building and training the emotion detection model.
* Firebase : A set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google.
